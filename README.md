# Tweeter Project

Welcome to Tweeter! It's a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This project is AJAX based and allowed me to flex my HTML and CSS muscles. The website allows users to view tweets that have been posted, post new ones which show up without refreshing the page and is changes layouts depending on the device used.
